ORSX
====

ORS-X - an ORS Fork.


This is a fork of the Open Resource System originally developed by Fractal_UK for Kerbal Space Program.

NOTE:  While ORSX and ORS will cohabitate without any issues, there is no interop.  i.e. modules depending on ORS methods will not work with ORSX and vice versa.  This is by design, to prevent any actions in ORS from having a negative impact on players that use both ORS based mods (KSPI) and ORSX based mods (Karbonite, MKS/OKS, etc.)
